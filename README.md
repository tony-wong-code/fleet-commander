# Fleet Commander
#### An autobattler based on the space sandbox Eve Online. Pick your commander, build your fleet, and destroy the enemy's station!
---

##### AlgoExpert Winter 2020 SWE Contest Submission

##### Tested on Python 3.8.1 and pygame 1.9.6

### NOTE! this game takes about 15 seconds to load due to the image files for all 120+ ships (will be optimized later)

`py fleet_commander.py`

Notes:
=====
* Game is playable but left in the state of its contest submission.
  * The purpose was to get it playable without fruitlessly spending too much time on optimizations.
